Messi Goals

Use variables to find the sum of the goals Messi scored in 3 competitions
Information

Messi goal scoring statistics:
Competition 	Goals
La Liga 	43
Champions League 	10
Copa del Rey 	5
Task

    Create these three variables and store the appropriate values using the table above:

    laLigaGoals
    championsLeagueGoals
    copaDelReyGoals

    Create a fourth variable named totalGoals that stores the sum of all of Messi's goals for this year.


// My Solution:
var laLigaGoals = 43
var championsLeagueGoals = 10
var copaDelReyGoals = 5

var totalGoals = laLigaGoals + championsLeagueGoals + copaDelReyGoals


// Other Solutions:
var laLigaGoals = 43;
var championsLeagueGoals = 10;
var copaDelReyGoals = 5;

const goalScoringStatistics = [
  {
    competition: 'La Liga',
    goals: laLigaGoals,
  },
  {
    competition: 'Champions League',
    goals: championsLeagueGoals,
  },
  {
    competition: 'Copa del Rey',
    goals: copaDelReyGoals,
  }
]

const countGoals = (arr) => {
  let sum = 0;
  arr.forEach((item) => {
    sum += item.goals;
  });
  return sum;
}

var totalGoals = countGoals(goalScoringStatistics);


let goals = [43, 10, 5],
    [laLigaGoals, championsLeagueGoals, copaDelReyGoals] = goals,
    totalGoals = goals.reduce((s, v) => s + v);
