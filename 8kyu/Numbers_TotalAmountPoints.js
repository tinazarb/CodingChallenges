// Challenge:
Total amount of points

Our football team finished the championship. The result of each match look like "x:y". Results of all matches are recorded in the collection.

For example: ["3:1", "2:2", "0:1", ...]

Write a function that takes such collection and counts the points of our team in the championship. Rules for counting points for each match:

    if x>y - 3 points
    if x<y - 0 point
    if x=y - 1 point

Notes:

    there are 10 matches in the championship
    0 <= x <= 4
    0 <= y <= 4

    
console.log(points(["1:0","2:0","3:0","4:0","2:1","3:1","4:1","3:2","4:2","4:3"]) , 30);
console.log(points(["1:1","2:2","3:3","4:4","2:2","3:3","4:4","3:3","4:4","4:4"]) , 10);
console.log(points(["0:1","0:2","0:3","0:4","1:2","1:3","1:4","2:3","2:4","3:4"]) , 0);
console.log(points(["1:0","2:0","3:0","4:0","2:1","1:3","1:4","2:3","2:4","3:4"]) , 15);
console.log(points(["1:0","2:0","3:0","4:4","2:2","3:3","1:4","2:3","2:4","3:4"]) , 12);

// My Solution:
function points(games) {
  let points = 0;
  for (let i=0; i < games.length; i++) {
    let arr = games[i].split(":");
      if (arr[0] > arr[1]) {
          points += 3;
      } else if (arr[0] == arr[1]) {
          points += 1;
      } else {
          points += 0;
      }
    }
    return points;
}

// Other Solutions:
function points(games) {
  let total = 0;
  games.map(game => {
    if (game[0] === game[2]) {
      total += 1;
    } else if (game[0] > game[2]) {
      total += 3;
    }
  });
  return total;
}


function points(games) {
  var sum=0;
  for (var i=0; i<games.length; ++i)
  {
    if (games[i][0]>games[i][2])
      sum+=3;
    if (games[i][0]==games[i][2])
      sum+=1;
  }
  return sum;
}


const points=games=>games.reduce((output,current)=>{
    return output += current[0]>current[2] ? 3 : current[0]===current[2] ? 1 : 0;
  },0)
